    "text": "Critique\n\nThe graph I am critiquing is a chart released by the Republican Senate Budget Committee. It was released by Daniel Harper in 2012, an election year. I am critiquing this graph because it is incredibly misleading. It takes the initiative to insinuate that millions of individuals are receiving welfare. The title states that over 100 million people are now receiving welfare. What the title does not state is that the y-axis starts at 94,000,000. 94 million! The exclusion of the digits prior to 94,000,000 creates an inaccurate data visualization of the state of federal welfare."
